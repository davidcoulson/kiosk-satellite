# Alarms

Kiosk Satellite has alarms of its own. They live on the kiosk and ring without Home Assistant, a network or the dashboard. You get a list with a switch per alarm, a scroll wheel to pick the time, one page for the details and a full screen with Snooze and Stop when an alarm rings.

Open the list from **Alarms** in the kiosk menu, from **Manage alarms** under **Settings, Alarms**, from the **Next alarm** screensaver widget or from the **Alarms** page of the remote admin.

## Setting an alarm

1. Tap **Set an alarm** and pick the time on the wheel. A device set to 24 hour time shows two wheels, otherwise there is an AM or PM wheel too.
2. **Set** saves the alarm, turned on, and a toast says how long until it rings.
3. The details page adds the rest. Tap **Done** to keep the changes or **Delete** to remove the alarm.

| Detail | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Repeat | The days the alarm rings on. With no day picked it rings once, at the next time the clock reads its time, then turns itself off and stays in the list. |
| Label | A name shown in the list and on the ringing screen. |
| Alarm tone | **Default** follows the Alarm tone setting. **Built-in alarm** is the sound bundled with the app. Any sound in the sounds folder works too. Picking a tone plays it once at the alarm volume. |
| Sunrise | The screen brightens gradually before the alarm rings. See [Sunrise](#sunrise). |
| Ease in the volume | The tone starts quiet and grows to the alarm volume over the **Ease in over** time. An alarm follows the default switch until you flip its own. |
| Speak when it rings | Home Assistant speaks a phrase between the rings. See [Spoken phrase](#spoken-phrase). |
| Phrase | Shows while Speak when it rings is on. It starts as the default phrase, and an alarm left on it follows later changes to the default. |

Tap the time on the details page to change it. The switch in the list turns an alarm on or off without opening it.

There is one alarm per time and repeat. Setting a time that already has an alarm on the same days opens that alarm, turned on, instead of adding a second one. The remote admin refuses the duplicate the same way.

## When an alarm rings

The alarm wakes the screen, comes in front of the dashboard or another app and plays its tone on the Android alarm stream, so a muted media volume does not silence it. It rings until one of these happens:

- **Stop** ends it. The stop word stops it too, the same way it stops a timer.
- **Snooze** holds it off for the snooze length, then it rings again. In the list a snoozed alarm says until when and carries a **Stop** button.
- **Silence after** runs out and it goes quiet on its own. It counts as stopped, not snoozed.

A tap anywhere else does nothing, so a brush of the hand never ends an alarm. Two alarms set to the same minute ring as one and show both labels. Under Lockdown Mode the screen takes no touch, so the stop word, Home Assistant or the remote admin stop the alarm there.

An alarm rings on its own full screen view, with one exception: when the screensaver is **Clock** or **Weather Mood** and its **Let alarms take over** switch is on (the default), the alarm rings on that screensaver instead. It keeps everything the screensaver is set to, including the font, colors, shadow, background, Night mode and corner widgets. The date line becomes the alarm's label and Snooze and Stop come in under the clock in the screensaver's own colors. A screensaver dimmed by its own brightness setting comes back to normal brightness while the alarm rings and dims again after Stop or Snooze. On Weather Mood the weather bar makes way for the two buttons. If something else is on screen, the alarm starts the screensaver first.

A kiosk that was switched off or restarted through the whole Silence after window skips the alarm rather than ring it late.

## Sunrise

A sunrise alarm starts before its time, as long as **Sunrise length** says. On the alarm's own view a glow rises from deep red to warm white while the screen brightens from its lowest level to full, then the alarm rings on the last color. A touch during the sunrise shows a **Stop** button for a few seconds, and Stop skips the ring too.

On a Clock or Weather Mood screensaver that lets alarms take over, the screensaver shows through the sunrise and only the brightness climbs. A touch that dismisses the screensaver ends the sunrise, and the alarm still rings at its time.

## Spoken phrase

An alarm with **Speak when it rings** on plays its tone twice, says its phrase, then plays the tone twice again, the way a timer speaks. `{label}`, `{time}` and `{day}` in the phrase become the alarm's label, its time and the day of the week, in the kiosk's language. The default is `It's {time}. {label}`. An alarm without a label drops the placeholder and the punctuation around it, so the default says "It's 7:00 AM."

Home Assistant makes the speech with the **Text to speech engine**, **Language** and **Voice** settings, the same way announcements are spoken, so the kiosk needs its Home Assistant address and token. The tone rings from the first second either way. When Home Assistant is slow or out of reach, the alarm rings without the words.

## Settings, Alarms

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Show in the kiosk menu | Adds the Alarms entry to the kiosk menu. On by default. |
| Manage alarms | Opens the alarm list. Shows when the next alarm rings. |
| Alarm volume | How loud alarms ring. It sets the Android alarm volume while an alarm rings and puts it back after, apart from the media and assistant volumes. |
| Ease in the volume | The default for new alarms and alarms that never chose: start quiet and grow to the alarm volume. Off by default. |
| Ease in over | How long the volume takes to grow, 5 to 120 seconds. Shows while Ease in the volume is on and applies to every alarm that eases in. |
| Alarm tone | The tone an alarm set to Default plays: the built-in alarm or a sound from the sounds folder. **Add a sound** copies a file into the folder, the same way the notification and announcement sounds work. |
| Snooze length | 5 to 30 minutes. |
| Silence after | How long an alarm rings when nobody stops it, 5 to 30 minutes. |
| Sunrise length | How long the screen takes to brighten before a sunrise alarm, 10 to 30 minutes. |
| Phrase | The default phrase for alarms that speak. |
| Text to speech engine | Under **Text to Speech**, the Home Assistant text to speech entity that speaks alarms. **First available** takes the first one Home Assistant has. |
| Language | The language alarms are spoken in, picked from the ones the engine lists. **Default** leaves it to the engine. Shown once an engine is picked by name. |
| Voice | The voice that speaks alarms, picked from the ones the engine lists for the language. **Default** leaves it to the engine. |

**Alarms** under **Kiosk Mode, Allowed Actions** decides whether the restricted kiosk menu offers the list too.

The screensaver waits while the alarm list is open, so it never cuts off an alarm being set.

[Fleet Management](fleet.md) syncs these defaults, Show in the kiosk menu included, under its Alarms category. The alarms themselves stay on each kiosk.

## Next alarm widget

**Next alarm** is a [screensaver widget](screensavers.md#widgets) that shows the next alarm when it rings within 24 hours, and the snooze while one runs. The corner stays empty the rest of the time. A tap on the widget opens the alarm list, the one spot on a screensaver that does more than dismiss it.

## Setting alarms by voice

Home Assistant has no alarm intent, so voice alarms go through an LLM conversation agent (Qwen, Gemma, Gemini, Claude, OpenAI or any other agent that can control Home Assistant). The agent understands the request in any language it speaks and calls a script that Kiosk Satellite ships as a blueprint.

The built-in **Home Assistant** conversation agent does not work for this. It only matches sentences against Home Assistant's own intents and cannot fill in the script's time, days or label. An LLM agent with **Prefer handling commands locally** turned on works fine: Home Assistant still handles lights, timers and the rest itself and passes alarm requests on to the LLM.

1. Import the blueprint:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjxlarrea%2Fkiosk-satellite%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fscript%2Fkiosk_satellite_alarms.yaml)

2. Create a script from it. It has no settings.
3. Expose the script to Assist under **Settings, Voice assistants, Expose**.

Then ask the kiosk: "wake me up at 6:30 on weekdays", "set an alarm called Gym for 7 tomorrow", "what alarms do I have?", "turn off the Gym alarm" or "delete my 6:30 alarm". The agent confirms what the kiosk did and when the alarm rings next.

It works in any language your agent speaks, with no sentences to set up per language. Ask in Spanish, German, French, Ukrainian or anything else the same way, like "despiértame a las seis y media de lunes a viernes", and the agent answers in that language.

The alarm goes to the kiosk you are talking to. A request typed into Home Assistant's own chat reaches no kiosk until it names one, as in "set an alarm on the bedroom kiosk", which matches the kiosk's device name or ESPHome name.

The kiosk listens for the script over its own Home Assistant connection, so it needs the Home Assistant address and token under **Settings, Home Assistant**, and the token has to belong to an administrator. With any other token the kiosk leaves voice alarms off and asks Home Assistant nothing. Nothing new appears in ESPHome.

### Good to know

- **Countdowns.** "Set an alarm in 20 minutes called Pizza" works as a kitchen countdown. The agent turns it into a clock time, and the alarm rings once, full screen and on the alarm stream, with the label on screen. It is accurate to the minute. For a countdown accurate to the second that you can pause, ask for a timer instead: "set a timer for 20 minutes". [Voice Satellite](voice-satellite.md#timers-announcements-and-conversations) shows it as a pill, and timers work with the built-in Home Assistant agent too.
- **Another room.** Name a kiosk to set its alarm from anywhere: tell the kitchen kiosk "set an alarm on the bedroom kiosk for 6:30 tomorrow" and the bedroom kiosk takes it.
- **One specific day.** A one time alarm rings the next time the clock reads its time, so "set an alarm for Friday at 7" usually becomes an alarm that repeats every Friday. Turn it off or delete it after it rings if you only needed it once.
- **Skipping a morning.** Turning off a repeating alarm stops it on every day until you turn it back on, with "turn my 6:30 alarm back on". There is no skip for one day only.
- **Moving an alarm.** There is no edit, so ask for both steps in one sentence: "delete my 6:30 alarm and set one for 7".
- **Automations.** The script works outside Assist too. Call it from an automation or a script with `kiosk` set, for example to set tomorrow's wake up from a calendar event. With a response variable, `action: list` returns the kiosk's alarms and when each rings next.

    ```yaml
    action: script.kiosk_satellite_alarms
    data:
      action: set
      time: "06:30"
      days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
      label: Work
      kiosk: Bedroom
    response_variable: result
    ```

**Manage alarms using Voice Satellite** under **Settings, Alarms, Voice Alarms** and on the remote admin's **Alarms** page opens this guide.

Stopping and snoozing a ringing alarm still works with the stop word, the screen and the **Stop alarm** and **Snooze alarm** buttons.

## Remote admin

The **Alarms** page lists every alarm with a switch, an edit button and a delete button. **Set an alarm** and the edit button open one dialog with the time, repeat days, label, tone, sunrise, ease in, the speak switch and the phrase. The same defaults as the device follow the list, including an **Upload** button for sounds from your computer. While an alarm rings, sits in its sunrise or is snoozed, the Overview shows a banner with Snooze and Stop.

## Home Assistant

The kiosk's alarms reach Home Assistant through [ESPHome](esphome.md):

| Entity | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Next alarm** | timestamp | The next alarm on the device, the kiosk's own alarms included, since they are scheduled as Android alarm clocks. |
| **Alarm ringing** | binary sensor | On while an alarm rings. |
| **Alarm snoozed until** | timestamp | When a snooze runs out, unknown when nothing is snoozed. |
| **Stop alarm**, **Snooze alarm** | button | The same as the buttons on screen. |

A morning routine is an automation that triggers when **Alarm ringing** turns off.
