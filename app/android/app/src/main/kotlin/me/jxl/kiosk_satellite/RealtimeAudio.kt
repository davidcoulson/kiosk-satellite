/**
 * The realtime voice session's playback sink: one streaming AudioTrack
 * played as media, fed the model's voice as raw mono PCM16 at the
 * provider's rate (24 kHz for OpenAI and xAI). What it plays goes to the
 * software echo canceller through a [TrackTap].
 *
 * It plays only while there is an answer. Feeding it silence between
 * answers, as a call's downlink does, made the echo canceller worse on a
 * Galaxy Tab S8, twice: a median of 388 against 59 in the microphone
 * while an answer played with the old reference clock, and 39 leaked
 * frames against 2 over a story with the new one. See RealtimeSession's
 * echo settling for what helps.
 *
 * It never drops a backlog. A realtime model sends its answer
 * faster than it plays, so the whole answer can sit in the queue, and
 * [flush] throws it away at once when the user talks over it. The frames
 * of the answer the listener has heard are counted apart from the
 * silence, so the Dart side can tell the model how much was heard.
 *
 * Methods (channel `kiosk_satellite/realtime_audio`):
 *  - start {sampleRate}: opens the track. The rate it plays at, 0 when
 *    it could not open.
 *  - write <bytes>: one chunk, queued to the writer thread.
 *  - flush: drops everything queued and buffered, returns the answer
 *    frames played so far.
 *  - status: {played, written} in answer frames.
 *  - stop: releases the track.
 *
 * The volume is the assistant fader, like every Voice Satellite sound.
