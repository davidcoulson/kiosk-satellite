 * asks for it, and hands every chunk to [process] on its thread before any
 * consumer sees it, so the wake word, Assist, realtime conversations, the
 * intercom and the RTSP stream all hear the cleaned microphone.

 * nothing in the reference there is no echo to take out, and the idle
 * microphone goes through untouched. The canceller itself stays loaded, so
