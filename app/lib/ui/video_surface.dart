/// Opening a video the way a broken hardware decoder will accept.
///
/// Flutter renders a texture into an `ImageReader` on API 29 and up, and
/// that reader holds up to 7 images, so the native window asks the decoder
/// for 8 buffers beyond its own. Some MediaTek AVC decoders cap their
/// output port well below the sum and refuse every count ACodec tries
/// (issue #374, reproduced on an Echo Show 8):
///
///     [OUTPUT] ... nBufferCountActual(6)
///     [OMX.MTK.VIDEO.DECODER.AVC] setting nBufferCountActual to 14 failed: -22
///     ... 13, 12, 11 ...
///     Failed to allocate buffers after transitioning to IDLE state
///     Decoder init failed: OMX.MTK.VIDEO.DECODER.AVC
///
/// A SurfaceView keeps only two or three buffers back, so the same file and
/// the same decoder start fine through a platform view. The texture stays
/// the default everywhere - it composites inside Flutter and costs less -
/// and only a device that fails this way pays for the second attempt.
///
/// Samsung Exynos devices start on the platform view instead (issue #894).
/// Their decoders hand out SBWC compressed frames, and importing those
/// into Flutter's GPU context leaks the decompressed copies: a Galaxy Tab
/// S9 FE grew by gigabytes of EGL memory and never gave it back. A
/// SurfaceView passes the frames to SurfaceFlinger, which reads SBWC as is.
