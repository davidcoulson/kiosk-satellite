/// blocked, a dead wall until someone kills the process.

///     cannot come up without a working attach, so its prolonged absence
///     is the wedge. (A kiosk: an agent-mode install has no WebView by
///     design, and the watchdog never arms there.) Transients (a settings-triggered WebView rebuild) last
///     moments; the watchdog needs three consecutive strikes 5s apart.
///
/// Recovery escalates. First a WebView rebuild in place: the create-raced-
/// attach variant (issue #145 — the platform view was requested before the
/// Activity attached, failed once, and never retries) heals with a fresh
/// widget now that the Activity is up. Then, strikes later, a full process
/// restart through the background bridge: for the failed-re-attach variant
